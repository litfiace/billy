      <h3 id="headline">Here is a highlight of some of Diego Maradona's greatness.</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Maradona Cup.</strong> The Argentine Super League Cup was renamed the 'Maradona Cup' shortly
          after the World Cup-winner's passing. The final this past year was contested between Boca Juniors and Banfield
          - Maradona would've
          been glad to hear that it was Boca who won it.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Letter from French president Emmanuel Macron.</strong> After Maradona's death celebrities,
          politicians, musicians etc. All paid tribute - however the one tribute that stood out above the rest was a
          lengthy letter written by French
          president Emmanuel Macron.

          Macron hailed Maradona as "the undisputed owner of the ball, so loved by the French people". Kind words
          indeed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Statues</strong> Well, there's been plenty of these that have popped up in the last year.

          A sculpture was erected in the Azteca Stadium to honour his astonishing solo goal against England, a square in
          Rio De Janeiro was named after him, and a statue was built in the Madres de Cities Stadium in Santiago del
          Estero. Just to name a
          few.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Re-named streets</strong> Along with statutes being erected, plenty of street were just downright
          named after Diego too. The Rio de Janeiro Street in Lanus because the 'Diego Armando Maradona Street', as did
          streets in Berazategui
          and Merlo.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Haka</strong> One of the most emotional tributes in the weekend after Maradona died was delivered
          by the All Blacks, who before their traditional 'haka' offered a shirt to the Argentine rugby team in
          Maradona's honour.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Diego Armando Maradona Stadium</strong> The stadium where Maradona became a Serie A legend was
          rightly named after the former Napoli superstar immediately after his passing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Argentino Juniors 'sanctuary'</strong> - The club who found Maradona way back in the mid 70s have
          built a special room to house as much El Diego memorabilia as possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Murals</strong> There have always been murals of Maradona all around Naples and Argentina - and since
          his death even more have been painted to pay tribute to his greatness.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Goal celebrations</strong> - Basically every goal that was scored in the immediate aftermath of
          Maradona's death was dedicated to football's greatest ever - but none were more heartfelt than Lionel Messi's.
          The superstar forward
          scored against Osasuna and then revealed a Newell's Old Boys shirt with number 10 on the back.
        </li>
      </ul>
